AddressBook using OOP

`assistant.py` contains classes `AddressBook`, `Record`, `Field`, `Name`, `Birthday` and `Phone`

method `days_to_birthday` of class `Record` calculates and returns number of day to the next birthday.

AddressBook's iterator can return all Records in parts of given size

inner logic and CLI will have been developed.
